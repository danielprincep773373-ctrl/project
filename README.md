How It Works

User Registration/Login:

New users sign up using email or OAuth (Google/Spotify).

JWT tokens or Firebase Auth handle secure sessions.

Search and Discover:

The app connects to the Spotify or YouTube API to fetch songs dynamically.

Users can explore trending tracks or search by title, artist, or album.

Create & Manage Playlists:

Users add songs to playlists, rename or delete them anytime.

All playlists are saved in the cloud and synced in real-time.

Music Playback:

The player allows users to stream songs directly, with smooth transitions.

Playback progress, duration, and controls are managed via React states.

Personalization:

Liked songs, recent plays, and playlist data are stored per user.

Dark/light themes adapt to user preferences automatically.
